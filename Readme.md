## Description

- Create Flask application
- Create database to your site subject
- The options of the site will be to charge an information about new country,like:
  1.  image

## Design 

This is a Flask web application that has functionality to store information about countries, such as name, position, capital name, official language, best 10 places, and a profile picture.<br>
This information is stored in a SQLite database using the SQLAlchemy library. The user can add, delete, or view information about a country.
The uploaded images are stored in a folder,<br>
and the path to the image is stored in the database. The file format of the images must be in 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg' or 'gif'

## Table of Contents
Depending on the  project directory and the contents of the files, I will divide the contents:
1. README.md 
2. app.py - it contain code that sets uo the application
3. templates - it contain all the HTML files 
4. static - it contain the upload images and the CSS file
5. instance - file that contains configuration settings or data specific to an individual instance of a software application
6. migrations - is a versioned change to the database schema, used for version control and to keep track of changes made to the database over time.

## Tests

The following tests we may run in the application to ensure it's functioning correctly:
1. Unit tests: to test individual functions and modules
2. Integration tests: to test the interaction between different parts of the application.
3. Functional tests: to test end-to-end functionality of the application, simulating a user's actions.
4. Load tests: to test the performance and scalability of the application under heavy loads.
5. Security tests: to test for vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
6. Usability tests: to test the user interface and the user experience of the application.
